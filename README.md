# Nanodegree-InventoryApp
Android Basics Nanodegree Final Project

Project Overview
This project is a chance for you to combine and practice everything you learned in this section of the Nanodegree program. You will be making an app to track a store's inventory.

The goal is to design and create the structure of an Inventory App which would allow a store to keep track of its inventory of products. The app will need to store information about price, quantity available, supplier, and a picture of the product. It will also need to allow the user to track sales and shipments and make it easy for the user to order more from the listed supplier.

Why this project?
In the most recent portion of the Nanodegree program, you learned about data storage in Android, using both SQLite tables and file storage on the device. These skills let you build apps which are critical to small businesses worldwide. By practicing these skills and building this app, you will have the foundation to build similar apps for any kind of business.

What will I Iearn?
This project is about combining various ideas and skills we’ve been practicing throughout the course. They include:

Storing information in a SQLite database
Integrating Android’s file storage systems into that database
Presenting information from files and SQLite databases to users
Updating information based on user input.
Creating intents to other apps using stored information.

PROJECT SPECIFICATION
Inventory App

Layout

CRITERIA
Overall Layout: The app contains a list of current products and a button to add a new product.

List item layout: Each ListItem displays the product name, current quantity, and price. Each list item also allows the user 
to track a sale of the item

Detail layout: The detail layout for each item displays the remainder of the information stored in the database. The detail layout contains buttons to modify the current quantity either by tracking a sale or by receiving a shipment. The detail layout contains a button to order from the supplier. The detail view contains a button to delete the product record entirely.

Layout Best Practices :The code adheres to all of the following best practices: Text sizes are defined in sp, Lengths are 
defined in dp Padding and margin is used appropriately, such that the views are not crammed up against each other.

Default Textview: When there is no information to display in the database, the layout displays a TextView with instructions on how to populate the database.

Functionality
Runtime Errors: The code runs without errors

ListView Population: The listView populates with the current products stored in the table.

Add product button: The Add product button prompts the user for information about the product and a picture, each of which are then properly stored in the table.

Input validation: User input is validated. In particular, empty product information is not accepted.

Sale button: The sale button on each list item properly reduces the quantity available by one, unless that would result in a negative quantity.

Detail View intent: Clicking on the rest of each list item sends the user to the detail screen for the correct product.

Modify quantity buttons: The modify quantity buttons in the detail view properly increase and decrease the quantity available for the correct product. The student may also add input for how much to increase or decrease the quantity by.

Order Button: The ‘order more’ button sends an intent to either a phone app or an email app to contact the supplier using the information stored in the database.

Delete button: The delete button prompts the user for confirmation and, if confirmed, deletes the product record entirely and sends the user back to the main activity.

External Libraries and Packages: The intent of this project is to give you practice writing raw Java code using the necessary classes provided by the Android framework; therefore, the use of external libraries for core functionality will not be permitted to complete this project.

Code Readability
CRITERIA

Naming conventions: All variables, methods, and resource IDs are descriptively named such that another developer reading the code can easily understand their function.

Format: The code is properly formatted i.e. there are no unnecessary blank lines; there are no unused variables or methods; there is no commented out code. The code also has proper indentation when defining variables and methods.
